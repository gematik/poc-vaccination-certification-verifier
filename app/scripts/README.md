# Introduction

Currently, the user interface for all the functionality in this project is a
command line tool. Although this is sufficient, typically, it is rather
error-prone to type lengthy commands with lots of parameters.

This directory provides shell-scripts which are more user-friendly (but maybe)
not as flexible as using the command line itself. Well, there is always a
trade-off ;-)

All scripts are written with bash-shell in mind. To run such scripts on a
Windows machine, [git-bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) is recommended.

For a good start try the following: `./clean.sh && ./allInOne.sh`.
